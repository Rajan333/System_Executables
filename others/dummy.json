                        "TINY teenager Hannah Kritzeck loves singing, ballet and dancing to hip-hop, despite being just 39in tall. The 19-year-old was born with primordial dwarfism, a rare condition that only affects about 100 people in the world, which causes short stature and health problems, including the threat of brain aneurysms and a shortened life-span. Hannah, who wears children's size four shoes, has to bravely face the reality of her condition, while also dealing with the normal teenage challenges. A new film follows Hannah as she prepares for graduation from high school, choosing a career, dreaming about boys and finding a date for her end of year prom. The bubbly teen, who weighs just over two stone, also spends her free time taking hip-hop and ballet classes and has her own voice coach.  Hannah was adopted by Jackie and Larry Kritzeck at birth and grew up in Minnesota, USA, but she soon learned her normal teenage experiences were going to be different from those of her friends. Her condition comes with many medical needs including annual MRI scans to check for the possibility of brain aneurysms and because her teeth and mouth are so small she has dental implants. She also developed scoliosis and had two titanium rods placed in her back when she was young. But despite the limitations posed by her condition, Hannah has never let it get in the way of her passion for dancing. * Little and Looking for Love is on Wednesday February 11, 9pm, on TLC",

Aliya Saleem, whose parents live in a remote village in the Indian state of Jharkhand, was born at a relatively large 4kg (9lbs), but started rapidly piling on the pounds once she hit the four month mark. Her enormous weight has put her life in danger and placed a huge strain on the already limited finances of her parents, dad Mohammad Saleem and mum Shabana Parveen, who are struggling to cover the costs of her daily food intake and the regular need for new clothes. The family has until now been unable to afford to take her to a hospital, but were able to get a consultation at Fortis Hospital to see a specialist in a bid to get to the bottom of Aliya's condition.",

The Bono tidal bore - which surges down the river Kampar in a remote region of Indonesia - has become legendary in surfing circles. The challenging wave is said to travel around 10mph, but has been known to roll up to 30 miles upriver before breaking - helping some surfers ride waves for an hour straight. It means surfers have begun flocking to the area around full and new moons to make the most of the phenomenon. But the wave - created by a strong tide pushing up the river, against the current - isn't for the feint hearted. Crocodiles, pythons and boa constrictors are said to inhabit the river basin. But despite the potential dangers, unfazed riders packed a stretch of the Kampar river during November's Bono Bekudo cultural festival.",
